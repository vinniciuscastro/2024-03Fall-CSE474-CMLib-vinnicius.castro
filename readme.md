Configuration Management Library

Welcome to the Configuration Management (CM) Library! This document provides an overview of what configuration management entails, the libraryâ€™s objectives, and guidelines for usage.

Configuration Management is a systematic process used to manage changes in a project or system, ensuring that performance, functionality, and quality remain consistent. It is critical for large and complex projects, where managing changes and maintaining the integrity of the system is essential for success.

The primary goal of this CM Library is to provide tools and processes that help teams manage system configurations effectively. It seeks to ensure consistency and reduce errors through structured change and version management.

This CM Library is divided between the Product Library with 3rd Party, Deliveries, Setup, Source Code documentation, and Project Library with Project Documents, Reports, Software Engineering, and System Engineering updates.
